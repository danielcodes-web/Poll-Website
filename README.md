Poll Site

Built with HTML, CSS, JS on Visual Studio. Used base stylings.

Intended to have multiple poll options that would only be allowed to vote on once with the home page listing all available polls. Issues with server development and implementation due to a lack of time and overall knowledge when connecting to a local data file. The site was also intended to follow the MVC structure if I had managed to complete all of the objectives in time.

Simple acceptance and usability tests were completed in order to make sure the site was in a somewhat usable condition even without some of the main objectives being acheived. Site is not secure, again due to a lack of time.
